## My process
- First I began by sketched and identified the layout components
- Then builted out the HTMl file
- First insert the img into the background
- add background to container class and padding and margin height and width
- apply style to header and sub header class
- hidd the attribution class
 - hear I noticed that My application was no longer centered so I looked up  a solution on mdn
- applied display: flex  in both the body element and container / all alignment issues were fixed
- then applied shadowing to both the container and inner container claas and round out the corners
- last I used @media to make changes for mobile use

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
